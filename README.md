# Overview
The job starts at the Innocence Blvd 24/7.  Male characters must change their ped.  Female characters will put a uniform on the mp_female
when going on duty.  Once on duty, the player can either RP working in the store or go on deliveries and make extra money.  The number of
deliveries are random in how many and locations chosen from a pool of 10.  Delivery points farther from the store pay better than closer
